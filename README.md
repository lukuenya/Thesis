# PROJECT OVERVIEW
This project is for my master thesis in Data Science. The aim is to develop a machine learning model that predicts frailty scores based on both the FRIED protocol and the "Expert's Eye." The focus is on understanding the features driving these scores, comparing the two scoring systems, and identifying their common feature space to improve explainability and clinical utility.
